Given a matrix of integers A with R rows and C columns, 
find the maximum score of a path starting at [0,0] and ending at [R-1,C-1].

The score of a path is the minimum value in that path.  

A path moves some number of times from one visited cell to any neighbouring unvisited cell in one of the 4 cardinal directions (north, east, west, south).
