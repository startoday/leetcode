We distribute some number of candies, to a row of n = num_people people in the following way:

We then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give n candies to the last person.

Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving n + 1 candies to the first person, n + 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give 2 * n candies to the last person.

This process repeats (with us giving one more candy each time, and moving to the start of the row after we reach the end) until we run out of candies.  The last person will receive all of our remaining candies (not necessarily one more than the previous gift).

Return an array (of length num_people and sum candies) that represents the final distribution of candies.



#brute force 居然就能过 --数学做法就是和solution 一样，算层数， 我临场没写出来（看到0.25， 0.5的对c++ 不确定咋样）
#数学法， 思路都一样，但是算人头再分层减少了 int 啥的计算不同
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> distributeCandies(int candies, int num_people) {

    int n = num_people;
    // how many people received complete gifts
    int p = (int)(sqrt(2 * candies + 0.25) - 0.5);
        
    int remaining = (int)(candies - (p + 1) * p * 0.5);
    
    int rows = p / n, cols = p % n;

    vector<int> res(n,0);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      // complete rows
      res[i] = (i + 1) * rows + (int)(rows * (rows - 1) * 0.5) * n;
      // cols in the last row
      if (i < cols) res[i] += i + 1 + rows * n;
    }
    // remaining candies        
    res[cols] += remaining;
    return res;
        
    }

#我的写法

            for(int j = 1; j <= num_people; ++j){
                res[j - 1] += i;
                candies -=i;
                i++;
                if(candies < 0) {
                    res[j - 1]+= candies;

#别人的类似写法

        while(candies) {

            int give = min(c, candies);
            result[i] += give;
            candies -= give;
