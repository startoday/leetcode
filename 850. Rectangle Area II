We are given a list of (axis-aligned) rectangles.  
Each rectangle[i] = [x1, y1, x2, y2] , where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the ith rectangle.

Find the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane.  
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note:

1 <= rectangles.length <= 200
rectanges[i].length = 4
0 <= rectangles[i][j] <= 10^9
The total area covered by all rectangles will never exceed 2^63 - 1 and thus will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
