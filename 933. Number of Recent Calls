Write a class RecentCounter to count recent requests.

It has only one method: ping(int t), where t represents some time in milliseconds.

Return the number of pings that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.

Any ping with time in [t - 3000, t] will count, including the current ping.

It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than before.

 

Example 1:

Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
Output: [null,1,2,3,3]

#我的老天鹅，又是一道读不懂题意的谜题。。。其实意思是，问x-3000 to x range has how many calls？
#过了，用queue记录存活的3000最近。。所以RecentCt 这个function？（看别人也没用233）
class RecentCounter {
public:
    RecentCounter() {
        
    }
    
    int ping(int t) {
        while(!q.empty() && q.front() + 3000 < t) {
            q.pop();
        }
        q.push(t);
        return q.size();
    }
    queue<int> q;
};
