There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.

Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.

You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.

 

Example 1:

Input: keyboard = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", word = "cba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The index moves from 0 to 2 to write 'c' then to 1 to write 'b' then to 0 again to write 'a'.
Total time = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

class Solution {
public:
    int calculateTime(string keyboard, string word) {
        unordered_map<char, int> pos;
        for(int i = 0; i < keyboard.size(); ++i) {
            pos[keyboard[i]] = i;
        }
        int res = pos[word[0]];
        for(int i = 1; i < word.size(); ++i) {
            res += abs(pos[word[i]] - pos[word[i - 1]]) ;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
