We run a preorder depth first search on the root of a binary tree.
At each node in this traversal, we output D dashes (where D is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  
(If the depth of a node is D, the depth of its immediate child is D+1.  The depth of the root node is 0.)
If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.
Given the output S of this traversal, recover the tree and return its root.

Example 1:
Input: "1-2--3--4-5--6--7"
Output: [1,2,5,3,4,6,7]

Note:
The number of nodes in the original tree is between 1 and 1000.
Each node will have a value between 1 and 10^9.

#给一个string作为input 是一个BINARY TREE preorder遍历所得，dash数量代表层数， root的 dash量是0， return tree的root
##如果只有一个child的话，guarantee是left child
