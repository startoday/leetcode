#Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
#Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
#Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
Example of matrix：
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
#与1相比，没有保证下一行的第一个值一定大与上一行的最后一个值
