Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

Example 2:
Input: nums = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: []

Example 4:
Input: nums = [-2,0,0,2,2]
Output: [[-2,0,2]]
