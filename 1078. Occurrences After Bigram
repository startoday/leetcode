Given words first and second, consider occurrences in some text of the form "first second third", where second comes immediately after first, and third comes immediately after second.

For each such occurrence, add "third" to the answer, and return the answer.

Example 1:

Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
Output: ["girl","student"]

#练习了stringstream，--可以只存string，以空格断开
#其实不需要vector， 俩string 就行
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findOcurrences(string text, string first, string second) {
        istringstream is(text);
        vector<string> temp (3, ""); 
        vector<string> res; 
        string s;  
        while(is>>s)  {  
            temp[2] = s;
            string x = temp[0];
            string y = temp[1];
            if(x == first && y == second && temp[2] != "") res.push_back(temp[2]);
            temp[0] = y;
            temp[1] = temp[2];
        }  
        return res;   
    }
};
