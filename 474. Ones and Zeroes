#suppose you are a dominator of m 0s and n 1s respectively. 
#On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s
#your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. 
#Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.
Example 1:

Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4

Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are “10,”0001”,”1”,”0”
Example 2:

Input: Array = {"10", "0", "1"}, m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".
